# mtg_utils

This repository contains a bunch of Magic: The Gathering related Python scripts.

### Description

<code><i>deck2csv.py</i></code> reads a txt file containing a list of cards, grabs some data about each card via a request to the Scryfall API and writes everything into a CSV file.

### Requirements

For now, you only need [alive-progress](https://pypi.org/project/alive-progress/). The rest is not unusual.
